# Hello there, I'm Itay
*i wrote all of this readme using chat-gpt cause i can*

I'm an 18-year-old Full Stack developer from Israel with a keen interest in Cyber, Game Development, and Software Development. I'm proficient in C#, Python, and JavaScript and I enjoy using these languages to build and explore new ideas. Currently, I'm dipping my toes into the world of Machine Learning; I'm still learning, but very excited about this new journey. My exploration into new areas of coding is driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to enhance my own experience in the tech field.

Currently working for a start-up company while finishing high school.
